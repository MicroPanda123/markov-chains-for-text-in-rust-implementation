# markov-chains-for-text-in-rust-implementation

This is my first project in Rust, and for this purpose I decided to rewrite my [markov-chains-for-text-in-python-implementation](https://github.com/MicroPanda123/markov-chains-for-text-in-python-implementation), for now I only rewrote user part, so it cannot generate models, only use them, but it's 100% compatible with python models (I mean, duh, if it weren't then there wouldn't be any models for it).
